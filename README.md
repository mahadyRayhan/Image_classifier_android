# Image Classification Android App Using Tensorflow

The objective of this project is to classify an image taken by the phone camera. But as the model file is very big and can not be uploaded in Github, i also describe the process of training the image classification model here.

So the main parts of this project will be:

1. Train the image classification model
2. Convert tensorflow model to tflight (To integrate in the android app)
3. Develop the android app
